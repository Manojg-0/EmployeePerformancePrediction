# Employee Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to **predict employee performance** using Machine Learning techniques. By analyzing various factors such as experience, job role, training, and performance metrics, the system classifies employees into categories like **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** performers.  

It is implemented as a **Streamlit web application**, enabling HR teams to evaluate performance, visualize results, and make data-driven decisions.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Traditional performance evaluation methods rely on manual reviews, which are often:
- Subjective and biased  
- Time-consuming  
- Lacking transparency and scalability  

This project addresses these limitations by applying **data-driven Machine Learning models** for **objective, fair, and consistent performance evaluations**.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a predictive model to classify employees into performance categories.  
- Enhance HR decision-making with data-driven insights.  
- Provide an easy-to-use interface for HR professionals.  
- Optimize workforce management and reduce employee turnover.
